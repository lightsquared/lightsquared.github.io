I’m a PhD student in the Department of Mining and Nuclear Engineering at MST. Paul Worsey is my advisor, and I'm studying the relationship between blast positive-phase-duration and the oxygen-balance of an explosive. More generally, I’m interested in understanding the blast parameters at small scaled distances. I’m passionate about programming in Python, Julia, and R. I'm working on an explosive engineering library for Python and Julia (maybe).

When I’m not doing research, I spend my time working as Chief of the Explosives R&D Division at the National Center for Explosives Training and Research. I also co-Chair the Science Panel for the Institute of Makers of Explosives. The Science Panel has allowed me the opportunity to work with some of the best minds in explosive engineering and safety.

When I’m not doing those things, I’m probably hanging out with my wife and kids. I also enjoy fly fishing in Northern Alabama.
