When the [United States Department of Defense Explosives Safety Board (DDESB)][9615d5d6] determines fragment and debris hazards they use a 6-step process based on [Technical Paper 12][1096b4d4] (TP-12).  I was using this process recently in a paper and ran down a rabbit hole when I got to step 4.  Before I drag you down the hole, let me paraphrase *all* the steps as they are listed in TP-12.

1.  1. Determine initial fragment velocity either using the appropriate Gurney equations (or determine experimentally). The general Gurney equation is given by:

$x=10$
