A series of lock breaching tests are described in which five sets of standard shackle locks and 4 sets of puck style locks were tested for vulnerability to a Dremel rotary tool, an oxyacetylene torch, a drill press, a low temperature impact, and compressive cutting jaws. In the Dremel rotary tool test, the lock shackles were exposed to a Dremel abrasive cutting wheel for a fixed time and the depth of penetration was measured. In the oxyacetylene test, the lock shackle was moved under an oxyacetylene flame at a constant velocity and the depth of cut was measured. In the drill press test, the lock was confined in a vice and two drill attempts were made using two different diameter drill bits and the percent of lock failures was recorded. In the low temperature impact test, a pendulum was dropped while the lock temperature was lowered using difluoroethane (canned air) and the percent of lock failures was recorded. Finally, in the compressive cutting test, the lock shackle was pressed by carbide tipped cutting jaws and the maximum force at failure was measured. Results were compared to a previous study and were in general agreement, except the low temperature impact test.
