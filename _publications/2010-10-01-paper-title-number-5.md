Recognizing the role low-explosive powders play in bombings is essential for counter-improvised explosive device (IED) efforts and requires field testing of these powders to assess the hazards. The Inspire 14 magazine details the construction of an improvised hand grenade from a pipe elbow utilizing firework powders; however, its viability and lethality are unknown. Using pencil probes, flash panels, and high-speed imaging we identified the ranges for the lethality for both flash powder and assorted firework fillers. This study provides insight into the potential damage an improvised hand grenade could inflict utilizing low-explosive powder fillers.
